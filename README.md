A library that adds the
[Pedestal](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal) underpinnings needed when exposing
[Lacinia](https://github.com/walmartlabs/lacinia) as an HTTP endpoint.

Lacinia-Pedestal also supports GraphQL subscriptions, using the same protocol
as [Apollo GraphQL](https://github.com/apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws).

## Usage

For a basic Pedestal server, simply supply a compiled Lacinia schema to
the `com.walmartlabs.lacinia.pedestal/pedestal-service` function to
generate a service, then invoke `io.pedestal.http/start`.

```clojure
;; This example is based off of the code generated from the template
;;  `lein new pedestal-service graphql-demo`

(ns graphql-demo.server
  (:require [io.pedestal.http :as server]
            [com.walmartlabs.lacinia.pedestal :as lacinia]
            [com.walmartlabs.lacinia.schema :as schema]))

(def hello-schema (schema/compile
                   {:queries {:hello
                              ;; String is quoted here; in EDN the quotation is not required
                              {:type 'String
                               :resolve (constantly "world")}}}))

(def service (lacinia/pedestal-service hello-schema {:graphiql true}))

;; This is an adapted service map, that can be started and stopped
;; From the REPL you can call server/start and server/stop on this service
(defonce runnable-service (server/create-server service))

(defn -main
  "The entry-point for 'lein run'"
  [& args]
  (println "\nCreating your server...")
  (server/start runnable-service))
```

Lacinia will handle GET and POST requests at the `/graphql` endpoint.

```
$ curl localhost:8888/graphql -X POST -H "content-type: application/graphql" -d '{ hello }'
{"data":{"hello":"world"}}
```
